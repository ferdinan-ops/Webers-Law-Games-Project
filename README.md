# Webers Law Games Project
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Weber Law Games Project is a game of weber law. Weber’s Law can be used for  various sensory modalities in GUIs such as brightness, loudness, line length, visual weight of fonts in typography, color matching etc. Many times large amount of information is required to be displayed on a limited size computer screen. Information is displayed in various forms viz. text, pictures, drawings, maps, graphs, videos etc. Poor visual design of user interface lacks the ability of differentiating between two close enough visual stimuli e.g. two lines with different thicknesses in a map (for wide roads and narrow lanes).What is  this  threshold  of  line thickness that  may  lead  to  noticeable difference  is  governed  by Weber’s law.The threshold of noticeable difference between color shades is also governed by Weber’s law.</p>
